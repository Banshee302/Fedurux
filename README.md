This is the Kernels Source Code.
Fedurux (2024), By Red-Spirit.

This is just a basic operating system with a command-line and keyboard and minimal cursor support. 
It should be okay to just initlize itself, you dont need any external scripts as the kernel as of v1.0 does not support external libraries, though i am working on it.

Everything i make for the kernel will be as minimal as possible, if you would like to improve the system by making it better and using it for your operating system or if you want to
improve the source code for Fedurux message me on GitHub, my username is RedSpirit1.
