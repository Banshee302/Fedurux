This is the Kernels Source Code.
Fedurux (2024), By Red-Spirit.

Fedurux(2024 Red Spirit) is a Free and Open Source Kernel, if you can please contribute to this Project as I will be releasing updates when I can but I dont have much time for stuff.
Fedurux is mainly community owned, I share Fedurux with the Community of the Fedurux Developers.

FCat-32 is being worked on and it is slowly being developed.
Check Wiki for More Info on Kernel.

Look at the Wiki On the Fedurux GitHub for Documentation.
